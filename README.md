# SoundSeekers

## General Conditions
- This mandatory project serves as the final assessment for the Professional Integration Seminar course.
- The project is divided into two partial submissions and one final submission:
  - The first submission will determine the grade for the first partial exam.
  - The second submission will determine the grade for the second partial exam.
  - The final submission will determine the grade for the final exam.
- Teams are required to present progress updates to the teaching staff and classmates every week. These presentations contribute to each studentâ€™s grade.
- The project will be developed in teams of 5-6 members, chosen by the students, and supervised by the course instructors.
  - Teams are formed in the first class and cannot be changed.
  - The instructors will serve as mentors and facilitators for the teams, assisting with any questions or concerns during the project development.
  - To ensure proper project tracking, students must maintain a Trello board updated with weekly progress to guarantee team transparency.

## General Guidelines for the Final Project Assignment
- Each team must define a real-world problem, which they will work on throughout the semester to develop an innovative technological solution that offers assistance, support, and/or resolution.
- The solution must be developed in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) format and must function correctly.

## Minimum Approval Criteria
- Submissions must meet all the specified requirements. Any missing element will result in a non-passing grade.
- The project must follow the guidelines and criteria taught during the course and in previous subjects.
- The quality and completeness of the documentation provided in the deliverables will be considered in the approval process. Documentation that does not meet expected standards of writing and quality will not be approved.
- The MVP must function correctly. If the teaching team finds the product non-functional, the submission will not be approved.
- All submissions must be made by the deadlines set in the course schedule. Late, incomplete, or insufficient submissions will be considered failed.
  - Only the failure of one of the two partial submissions will be considered. If both submissions are failed, the team members will lose regular course status and will not be eligible to make the final submission.
